# Laboratory Work #4: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Composition, and Tests

## Description
This project implements a car service application that processes cars generated by a script and organizes them into appropriate service stations. Each station serves cars based on their type (electric or gas) and dining preferences (people or robots). The application focuses on key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as abstraction, polymorphism, composition, and dependency injection.

## Objectives
- Design and implement an application using advanced OOP concepts.
- Develop clean, modular code with good testing practices.
- Implement a scheduling system to process car data efficiently.
- Practice Git branching and commit organization.

## Features
1. **Queue System**:
   - Interface for a queue that supports generic types.
   - Three concrete implementations of the queue.
   - Unit tests for queue functionality.

2. **Car Services**:
   - Abstract interfaces `Dineable` and `Refuelable`:
     - `Dineable`: Handles dining services for people or robots.
     - `Refuelable`: Handles refueling services for electric or gas cars.
   - Concrete implementations:
     - Dining services: `PeopleDinner`, `RobotDinner`.
     - Refueling stations: `ElectricStation`, `GasStation`.

3. **Car Station**:
   - A class combining a queue, refueling, and dining components.
   - Methods to enqueue cars (`addCar`) and serve them (`serveCars`).
   - Statistics tracking of serviced cars.

4. **File Integration**:
   - Reads car data from JSON files generated by an external script.
   - Processes cars and outputs matching statistics to verify correctness.

5. **Scheduling**:
   - A system to schedule tasks for reading files and serving cars at regular intervals.
   - Ensures efficient, non-blocking operations.

## Prerequisites
- **Programming Language**: TypeScript and Python.
- **Dependencies**:
  - A generator script for car data (`generator.py`).
  - JSON processing library.
  - A testing framework.
- **Git**:
  - Branch name: `oop-master-tasks`.
